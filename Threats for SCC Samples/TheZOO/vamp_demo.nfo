This demo is a full working CPCK Generated
virus (with VAMP added to it)

The stand alone "plug-in" and full instructions
for VAMP will be online shortly.

The poly is set to go off only when it infects
the normal.dot class section - this way it
changes once per machine. If you want to run
the VAMP engine from the VBE you can run the
middle sub (but only from the Active Document
class section) it is not set to run in the 
Normal class section.

I do suggest your run this from the VBE so
you can get a feel for what the code does
it's quite fun to watch.

peace
Vic
