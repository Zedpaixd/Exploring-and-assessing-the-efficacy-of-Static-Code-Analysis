\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cap:conclusion}

In conclusion, this study showcases the effectiveness of Static Code Checkers in detecting and fixing improvable code together with their vulnerabilities, all while acknowledging their limitations in various aspects and their incapability to detect threats or malicious behavior through code. That being said, while we can acknowledge the imperfections of Static Code Checking tools, it is inevitable to accept the fact that they can be of great aid and importance for the programmers and respectively in the development lifecycle of software; as long as their feedback will not be taken as final, but as mere guidance.
