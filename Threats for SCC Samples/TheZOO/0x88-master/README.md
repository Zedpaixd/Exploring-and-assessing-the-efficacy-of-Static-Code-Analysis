0x88 Exploit Pack
===================

0x88 exploit pack Decoded it was encoded in Zendguard so I have decoded it and shared for educational purposes. 

The Pack includes:
- Jpg + chm Exploit
- JRL Exploit
- ActivX Exploit
- ActivX2 Exploit
- XMLHTTP Exploit
- XHTA Exploit
- BIN-HEX Exploit
- XML Exploit
- PPP 4 Exploit
- WScript Exploit
- ANI Exploit
- IFRAME Tag Overflow Exploit
- Blnmgr.dll COM Object Remote Exploit
- Msdds.dll Remote Code Execution Exploit
- DHTML Object Memory Corruption Exploit
- Javaprxy.dll Object Remote Exploit
- Additional modules that can be easily connected (LZ SP2 and Cmd)
- Downloader with injection, into explorer.exe and weighing 1.8 Kb

I do not own this program nor did I develop it it was originally done by : 0x88 but it is well written and would be good for educational purposes therefore i decoded the original program to give this bit to aid anyone keen on writing their own exploit pack in the near future.
