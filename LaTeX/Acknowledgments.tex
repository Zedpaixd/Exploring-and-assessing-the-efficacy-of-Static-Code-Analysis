% \noindent To begin with, I would like to express my gratitude towards my thesis advisor Adrian Spataru for their support throughout the course of my research, providing information whenever needed and offering advice upon reaching a roadblock. Subsequently, Prof. Werner Ravyse has also provided great guidance on the scope of academic writing and on the approach of this paper over the issues mentioned.\\

% \noindent Furthermore, I would like to extend my thank yous to the people that volunteered to put their knowledge in the field of code vulnerabilities to the test and participate in the form that has been used to compare different Static Code Analysis tools to AI and to Humans. Without their help, I would not have been able to come across such interesting results and as a consequence, the paper wouldn't have showcased so many statistics and potentially useful information for the readers.




\noindent To begin with, I would like to express my sincerest gratitude towards my thesis advisor Adrian Spataru for his support throughout the course of my research, providing great guidance, knowledge, and resources that have been of great aid and helped me navigate through the complexities of my research topic. Subsequently, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Prof. Werner Ravyse whom I have met during my exchange studies in Finland. His input and feedback have been of great value in refining the scope of the paper together with them addressing some of the inconsistencies presented in my research.\\

\medskip

\noindent Conclusively, I would like to extend my gratitude to the individuals that have volunteered to participate in my research study. Their willingness of sharing their expertise and knowledge in the field of code vulnerabilities has made it possible to come up with interesting, yet relevant, results; results that I believe will bring value to future industry practitioners.
